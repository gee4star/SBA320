# Film Reels Movie Picker App
## The technologies used include React + Vite, and CSS
### Started from a wireframe to design the look I wanted the app to look like
### Usage instructions: write the name of video title you want to see in empty search bar, then press the submit button, your video choice title will appear below the bar. If you don't enter a video name choice in the search bar but push the submit button a random choice gif will be presented to you as a suggestion of a great video to watch
#### One unsolved problem for lack of time is, I would have liked to make the movie choices shuffle from a button five at a time, with one choiice showing up while the others disappeared
