# Film Reels Movie Picker App is the title of this project
## Overview: this project was made to assist any movie lover to find the name of their movie of choice and pertanent information about the movie, year it was created, director,awards received, language spoken, and much more
## The technologies used include React + Vite, and CSS
### Started from a wireframe to design the look I wanted the app to look like
### Usage instructions: write the name of video title you want to see in empty search bar, then press the submit button, your video choice title will appear below the bar. If you don't enter a video name choice in the search bar but push the submit button a random choice gif will be presented to you as a suggestion of a great video to watch
#### One unsolved problem for lack of time is, I would have liked to make the movie choices shuffle from a button five at a time, with one choiice showing up while the others disappeared
#### This app has three pages: display movie, choose, and display gif
#### Many of the resources used to complete this project are cited in thr comments
